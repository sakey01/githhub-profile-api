# GitHub Profile Viewer

## 💡 About the project

GitHub Profile Viewer is an application that lets you find any user by their github profile username. You can see public informations such as their follower count or repositories or much more...

Notes:
- This was my first time working with APIs. 
- Credit to AI as well for designing the display.

## 🛠️ Technologies

## 🚀 API Rate Limits
GitHub only allows 60 requests per hour per IP.

If you see ```"Rate limit exceeded"``` in the console, then you need to wait an hour.
